Welcome to Leev.

Leev is the perfect app to track the leave data for your group.


Currently, only one level of authentication is supported. This means that all users that create an account will have access to all data in the app (as opposed to a user only seeing users and services that they've created). Future releases will support this feature.

It is possible to create services anachronistically, in case you need to track data for services that have already happened.
